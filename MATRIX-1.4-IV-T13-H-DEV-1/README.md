# MATRIX 1.4 IV T13 Class-H Development Release I

This is development release I of class-H of MATRIX 1.4 IV T13 audio power
amplifier design. This model designed to yield at least 1400 watts RMS for
4-ohms loudspeaker. It includes the high speed TFF-like stepper, applies
the toggle flip-flop or T-type flip-flop principle.

## Feature: TFF-like Stepper

A TFF-like stepper is a sequential stepper that designed to work like a
toggle flip-flop. It will switch the power supply rails straightforwardly
even power amplifier reach 20 kHz signal amplification.

The TFF-like principle application will prevent unexpected drop of the
switching sequence by locking the stepper sensing input with the positive
feedback, like a toggled TFF.
