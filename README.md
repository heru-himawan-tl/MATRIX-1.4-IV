# Stepping IV of MATRIX 1.4 Audio Power Amplifier

MATRIX 1.4 is an audio power amplifier platform implemented Bipolar Junction
Transistor focused in analog principle and voltage feedback implementation.
It is designed to provide free, open, and legal distribution of technology
source either for DIY hobbies and/or for production purposes.

## About Stepping IV

This Stepping IV of MATRIX 1.4 is designed with complete helper circuits,
rather than the earlier of MATRIX 1.4. Some models of the main power amplifier
circuit are the continuity of Stepping II of MATRIX 1.4 known as "T13".
Shortly, the code name of this release is just "MATRIX 1.4 IV".

## New Helper Circuit Design

The following helper circuits are newly designed, those are fully different
from the earlier of MATRIX 1.4.

This MATRIX 1.4 IV available with the following helper circuits:

- Open Circuit Protector
- Short Circuit Protector
- Over Voltage Protector
- Soft Limiter
- Volume Control Amplifier
- Balanced Input Amplifier
- Signal Indicator
- Limiting Indicator
- Protect Indicator
